I am a PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu) (ECE) at Rice University in Houston, TX.  
My PhD research is advised by Dr. [Behnaam Aazhang](https://aaz.rice.edu/) and focuses on the analysis and implementation of numerical methods for differential equations and optimal control.
